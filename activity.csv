1,"Hey everyone, my name is Vishwas and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on React query.","Image: A person flying up in the air, looking down at a map spread out below as paths of various colors twist and turn across it."
2,In this introductory video we will talk about the what and why of React query and in the rest of the series we will explore the different features it provides.,"Image: A person in a plane, their hand reaching out of the open window to touch a flock of birds that swirls out around them."
3,"Now, what I'm trying to do is make this channel a onestop shop for everything related to React.","Image: A person hanging upside down from a hot air balloon, looking down below at a large cityscape with React query-style symbols embedded throughout."
4,So far we have tutorials on react fundamentals and advanced topics.,"Image of a rocket traveling through space, passing by an intricate, abstract pattern of stars in the background."
5,"React hooks, react, redux, react formic, react storybook, react, render practical, react, react table and react TypeScript.","Image of a spaceship passing through a swirling violet nebula, its engines glowing a bright blue."
6,To add to this list we are going to learn about the React query package.,"Image of a spacecraft heading towards a distant planet, the stars forming a bright trail around the craft."
7,Let's begin with the what?,"A person in a hot air balloon, navigating an ocean of React query symbols that are billowing through the sky."
8,What is react query?,"An astronaut in a spacesuit, trekking through a vast expanse of React query modules stretching across the horizon."
9,"Well, it is a library for fetching data in a React application.","A surfer catching an enormous wave of React query code, crashing around and over them."
10,Now you might wonder why would you need a library for data fetching?,"A group of friends embarking on a wild horseback riding journey through a majestic mountain range, the sun glinting off the snow-capped peaks against the cobalt sky."
11,"Since React is a UI library, there is no specific pattern for data fetching.","A graphical representation of a React Query call, with nodes connected to auto-generated search queries and responses."
12,What we typically do is make use of Use effect hook for data fetching and use state hook to maintain component state like loading error or the resulting data if the data is needed throughout the app.,"A website page with a streamlined interface occupying the top half of the screen, built with React Query data."
13,We tend to use state management libraries.,An interactive dashboard featuring real-time updates of React Query data from multiple sources.
14,But what is important to note here is that most of the state management libraries are good for working with client state like theme for the application or whether a model is open.,Image of a person sitting in front of a bookshelf surrounded by a wide array of data sets with a React Application open on their laptop.
15,They are not great for working with Asynchronous or Server State.,"Image of a person sitting in a bustling library with stacks of books, while their laptop displaying a React Application is in the foreground."
16,And this is because server state is very different to client state.,Image of a person eagerly reading while a React Application pops up on their laptop in the background of a sea of books and data sets.
17,Client state is persisted in your app memory and accessing or updating it is synchronous.,"An image of a group of people discussing in an old, crowded library, with rows of bookshelves and stacks of books surrounding them, and a window in the background revealing a stunning starry night sky."
18,"Server state on the other hand, is persisted remotely in a database perhaps and requires Asynchronous APIs for fetching or Updating.","An image of a person standing in an ancient library surrounded by massive marble pillars, surrounded by mountains and a serene lake in the background."
19,"Also, server state, unlike client state has shared ownership data can be updated by someone else without your knowledge, which can quickly lead to UI data that is not in sync with the remote data.","An image of a person standing in a sea of towering library shelves, looking up to discover planets and galaxies beyond reaching through the skylight at the top of the library."
20,"It becomes even more challenging when you have to deal with caching deduping multiple requests for the same data, updating still data in the background, performance optimizations when it comes to pagination and lazy loading, et cetera.","As our app progresses, we use the effect and state hooks to create a vibrant image of a map with vivid colors, depicting our journey so far."
21,"If you have to cater to all these in an application, it requires significant time and effort to do it all by yourself.",Our effect and state hooks intertwine with each other to create a mesmerizing image of a hot-air balloon soaring through a sea of clouds.
22,Or you can take the smarter approach and use a library which makes handling all these scenarios a walk in the park.,"The effects and state hooks form an alluring image of a desert oasis, with our journey so far creating a dynamic halo of light around it."
23,"And you have probably guessed it, that library is React Query.","Image of a globe, where one half is lit with a bright light while the other half is in darkness, to represent managing two different themes."
24,"I will even go to the extent of saying even if you don't have complex requirements like the ones I've stated here, watch this series and give React query a try for your data fetching needs because you'll not want to go back.","Image of a map with pins scattered at different points and an arrow moving across, to represent the journey of managing state while working with client data."
25,That is how amazing this library is.,"Image of various pieces of a large puzzle randomly scattered on a background, to represent the complexities of working with client state."
26,"Well, if I've convinced you, here are some of the features we are going to be implementing in this series with the React query package.",Image of a computer monitor displaying the words “Asynchronous and Server State” surrounded by a cloud of smoke.
27,"We're going to learn how to make basic queries, how to pull data work with React query DevTools, how to create reusable query hooks for data fetching, how to query by ID, parallel queries, dynamic queries, dependent queries, infinite and paginated queries.","Image of a worker in a suit, who is standing in the middle of a desert, looking up to a sky filled with lightning and filled with swirling clouds of smoke."
28,"We also need to keep in mind that server state is not just fetching, it also needs updating.","Image of a group of people, all holding glowing blue boxes in their hands, standing in the center of an abandoned ghost town. The sky is filled with swirling clouds of smoke, and a mysterious golden light radiates from the glowing boxes."
29,"We will learn how to update data using mutations, how to invalidate queries when a mutation is successful, optimistic Updates and we will wind up the series with a video on how to set up an axios interceptor and work with React query.",Image 1: A yellow taxi driving across a desert landscape with a bright orange sun setting in the background. Written in the sky above the horizon is “SERVER STATE” in bold white letters.
30,"By the end of the series, you'll have a really good knowledge of React query and data fetching in React.","Image 2: An astronaut hovering in a spacetime looking through a portal and into a vast, complex network of servers and clients. In the distance, written in purple letters, is “VERY DIFFERENT”."
31,"Hopefully, you will also be in a position to recommend this library at work and will be something your teammates appreciate as well.",Image 3: A breathtaking view of a mountain range with a golden sky topped off by two contrasting auroras. Written in bright white letters across the sky is the phrase “TO CLIENT STATE”.
32,"Before we start though, let me tell you that to make the most out of this series, you must know the fundamentals of React, including React hooks.","An astronaut floating in a field of stars and planets, a glowing data cube spinning in one hand and a global mother board in the other, connected to the data cube."
33,"If you are new to React, please make sure to go through the fundamentals and the hooks series on this channel.","A view of an infinitely large space station, with a glowing control panel in the foreground where a person is navigating and repairing a web of data cubes, flying around them in perfect formation."
34,"Alright, with this in mind, let's get started in the next video.","A nebula illuminated with abstract patterns, lines of code streaming lazily through the clouds, illuminated with a warm blue glow."
