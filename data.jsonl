So let us get right into it. Alright so this video is going to be very short because the process is extremely simple and we only need a few lines of code to make this work and essentially the idea is that we have an audio file. For example here I have this video sound.mp3 which is basically just the audio file or the audio data for one of my videos. We can play this here real quick. What is going on guys welcome back. I don't know if you can hear that right now. We'll learn about the Python package but it's essentially just one of my videos as an audio file and what we want to do now is we want to transcribe this professionally. We want to get the text for example to create subtitles or to just do some machine learning work to create a search engine for my videos. Maybe I want to transcribe all of my videos and I want to be able to create a search engine so that you can look for a term and then you can find where it occurs in a certain video that would be one use case but we want to do that professionally and we don't want to do this with a lot of mistakes. Now it's not going to be perfect because there are certain words that are not just not going to be recognized. So for example certain package names, certain names of applications and technologies that are not necessarily in the dictionary. Those are going to be a little bit more difficult to transcribe but essentially this is going to be a very high quality transcription. So what we're going to do is we're going to create a new Python file. I'm going to call this main py. We're also going to open up the command line and we're going to install a package called open AI dash whisper. And this is one of those models that you can use without token so you can just install the package and you can use it without an API key or anything. And what we're going to do here now is we're going to say import whisper. And then we're going to say model equals whisper dot load model. And we're going to load the base model. And the result of the transcription is going to be just a model dot transcribe. And we're going to pass here the video video on the score sound dot mp3 file. And then we just want to open a new file transcription dot txt in writing mode, s f f dot write and we're going to write a result into that file. But not the not the whole result but just the text that is produced. And that is the whole magic I think this is running locally. So we're not using some model in the cloud from open AI. I think this installs basically the model locally. I don't know if you have to have certain if you have to have certain GPUs or something that are a little bit more modern. I ran this also on my laptop that is now five years old and it has an AMD GPU. So you definitely don't have to have Nvidia. It worked perfectly fine. Now let's see if it works here as well. I think we're going to skip the whole process because it takes Oh, actually doesn't take too long. So we can actually wait for this. Or was this just a download? I think this was just a download. So it will probably take some time so we can skip to th re the transcription is done. All right, so it seems like the transcription is now done. So we can open up this transcription dot txt file. And we can see here what's going on guys. Welcome back in this video today we're going to learn about the Python package that allows us to automatically find and so on. So this is very accurate. This is exactly what I'm saying in the video. But I'm sure we are going to find some mistakes, modules and packages that are used in the project automatically create a requirements txt file. Let's get right into it. All right. So for this video today, I'm going to be working on Linux and so on. I think the package that we used to was piprex. So pipreqs, I think this is definitely not going to be transcribed properly. So let's see if it's somewhere occurs. Oh, piprex, there you go. So this doesn't work. Because of course, piprex, the package name pipreqs is not going to be recognized by opening iwhisper because it's just not a commonly used thing. But piprex, because rex is a word and pip is known as a package manager, this is going to be recognized. So you will have to do some manual adjustments here probably or you can just ignore it. But other than like these special names, I think everything should be transcribed. Correct. I'm not going to look through all of the text now. But I think that this is a very, very high quality transcription because if you compare this to something like just a basic speech recognition, which you can use, so you can just use the Python speech recognition module, you can go through the file, you can split it up, you can transcribe the individual pieces. First of all, it's a hassle because you have to not use too much data at once when you transcribe like that. But then again, every single word is probably or every other word is going to be incorrectly transcribed. So this is a very high quality transcription. And all of this is running locally on your machine for free. So you don't even have to use an API key. You don't have to use tokens or anything. I think you have to have some decent hardware. But as I said, I'm running this now on a pretty strong computer. But I also ran it on my laptop, which is not as strong. It's not even strong enough to record properly. So I think that most of you guys will be able to run this to some degree. All right, so that's it for today's video. I hope you enjoyed it. And hope you learned something.

{"prompt": "Generate many astonishing mid-journey prompt to generate images from the following content: The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know, if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change, you can mold it, that's maybe the most important thing, is to shake off this erroneous notion that life is is there and you're just going to live in it versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. I think about what Steve said all the time. He's right, but how do you reconcile what he just said with the fact that in a society of any size, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down? How do you stand out and make a difference without being cast out of the island? You have to stand out the right way and that's what we're talking about today. Let's get started. The Ragnarok is one of my favorite Marvel movies and it's easy to see why. I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them. That's what Thor is full of these kinds of unusual bits of humor and that's why it's one of the highest-rated Marvel movies of all time. When you want to do something new, it fundamentally means you have to make a break with tradition, how things were done in the past. Here's director and Otero Taika Waititi, the director of Ragnarok, on starting out early. I was told by the older generation of filmmakers and now I realize I shouldn't have listened to them in the first, I remember my first short films and stuff. Instinctively knew I wanted to do a certain thing in the film, but I was convinced by people who had more experience not to do them and to do things in a certain way and then only a year or two later I realized damn I was right. I want you to really notice what he said there, that he started off making short films with an idea of what he wanted, but immediately the traditionalists said no and that's the rub. You can't just do what other people do and expect to get ahead. You have to be different and sometimes that thing is precisely the thing other people say do not do. Hip-Hop is a key piece of American culture now and today it's actually hard to imagine a time when that wasn't true. Rick Rubin, the producer, he was one of the key people to produce this new sound and this is what it was like to be right there when things were brand new. I just loved the music. I would buy every 12 inch single that would come out when it would come out and none of them sounded like what it sounded like at the club. It wasn't related at all. Live, it was much more of a raw. It was like DJs and break beats and it was harder whereas the record sounded more like an R&B record, but with somebody rapping on it. What we know as rap today, that's not what those records sounded like. So I started making hip-hop records really with the idea of I just wanted as a fan to hear what it sounded like in a club. So it was almost like a documentarian style it was because I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't have any training or skill, but that was what allowed it to be new was it wasn't doing it the regular way. Rick Rubin could feel the energy in the clubs in New York City listening to early hip-hop and hip-hop artists and that was the magic he tried to bring into the music when he was producing it. So other people would feel that way too. Just like YTT, Rubin had to go with something a little bit different. The philosopher Osho says, creativity is the greatest rebellion in existence. If you want to create, you have to get rid of all conditionings. Otherwise, your creativity will be nothing but copying. It will just be a carbon copy. You can be creative only if you are an individual. You cannot create as  the mob psychology. The mob psychology is uncreative. It lives a dragging life. It knows no dance, no song, no joy. It is mechanical. Rick Rubin didn't make a hip-hop sound that sounded like all the other things people were doing. He had to break with the mob psychology and it is in that rebellion he helped create a new sound for a generation. So if we break with tradition and we don't copy others, does that mean we should do any random thing with no regard to what came before you? Absolutely not. If you look deeper, YTT and Rubin were both deep studies of their predecessors. If you think they were born with the goods, think again. Every master begins as a student. In Aikido, there's a concept called Shu Ha Rii. There are three stages. Shu, follow the rules. Ha, break the rules and remake the rules. Aikido master Endo Shasero Shihan stated, in Shu, we repeat the forms and disciplines ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these norms with no deviation. Next, in the stage of Ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process, the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in Rii, we completely  m the forms, open the door to creative technique and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart and mind desires unhindered while not overstepping laws. Shu Ha Rii, this is a cycle that we repeat over and over again. In software, we love talking about iteration, but the reality is that we can always make it better. By applying this method, YTT and Rubin, conscious or not of it, reached a stage of true creativity and innovation, where they were able to create works that were truly original and forward-thinking. YTT was able to blend humor, emotion, and imagination in a way that's both entertaining and thought provoking. For Rubin, he produced music that is raw, emotional, and groundbreaking. They both progressed from imitation and adherence to established rules to experimentation and adaptation to true creativity and innovation. Bruce Lee says, learning is definitely not a mere imitation or the ability to accumulate and conform to fixed knowledge. Learning is a constant process of discovery and a never, a concluding one. Not only is this the key to iteration, it's actually the key to mastery, being able to go from novice to world expert. Robert Green says, mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge. Don't be different for different sake. Build on what is there, but don't settle for just being the same as what you've already found. That's it for this week. I'll see you next week. you", "completion": "Image Description: Generate an image showing a person pushing a large stone, symbolizing the act of shaping and molding life.Image Description: Create an image with two contrasting paths, one representing conformity and the other representing embracing change and making a difference.Image Description: Generate an image of a nail sticking out among other nails that are hammered down, symbolizing the courage to stand out and be different.Image Description: Create an image showing a person standing on an island, representing the challenge of standing out while being surrounded by societal norms.Image Description: Generate an image showcasing Thor's character with a mix of humor and action.Image Description: Create an image highlighting the vibrant colors and distinct visual style of Thor: Ragnarok compared to other Marvel movies.Image Description: Generate an image of a person breaking chains or breaking through a wall, representing breaking free from traditional constraints.Image Description: Create an image showing a person walking on a path diverging from a conventional route, symbolizing the pursuit of new ideas and approaches.Image Description: Generate an image depicting a DJ mixing records, representing the unique sound and creativity of early hip-hop.

{"prompt": "Generate many astonishing mid-journey prompt to generate images from the following content: I think that first though we should start with a Ford. Ford made some moves. They did. Actually just one move. Yeah. They make one move. A couple of moves. Yeah, yeah. One move that has a couple moves inside of the singular move. They collapsed. They collapsed. Yeah, basically. Ford did a collab. It's like a multi-movement movement. Sure. A compound movement. Compound. There we go. There we go. Compound movement. So Tesla and Ford have collaborated. Basically what's happening is Ford has realized that Tesla superchargers are really, really good. And instead of contributing to a public network or building their own network, what they're doing is making their cars able to charge on as many Tesla superchargers as possible via several movements. One of those movements is by enabling them in Ford Pass. So you get an adapter theoretically, I believe. And in Ford Pass, you'll be able to pull up to any number of the enabled, I think, thousands of superchargers when this starts to go live and plug in your Ford EV at a Tesla supercharger. The other move, which I think is actually way more interesting, is starting in 2025. All of Ford's new shipping EVs will have the NACS connector. For those who don't know, that's the North American charging standard, I believe it's called. But that's the connector that all of Teslas use in North America. It's basically the charging port from a Tesla charger. So all of the Mach E's and F-150 lightnings and whatever other reviews they're making at that point, starting in 2025, will all have the Tesla connector and they'll be able to plug into a supercharger with no adapter, max speeds. I assume if you have an adapter, you're limiting your speeds. That's a pretty big shift. That's one way of addressing our customers really need more chargers. How do we feel about this? This just reminds me of this XKCD comic. If you've seen this one, I will read it to the audience. That's a classic situation. There are four competing standards. Fourteen, that's ridiculous. We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use cases. Yeah. Soon. Situation. There are 15 competing standards. That's happened a lot. It's kind of interesting though because in EV world, there's really two ports. 2.5. If you want to call it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. So, but the big ones are CCS and NACS. And it depends on kind of where you live, what you'll see a lot. If you live in Europe, you basically only CCS. Tesla's all have CCS, etc. In North America, in order to use a Tesla supercharger, you must be driving a Tesla, which uses a different port than all of the rest of the cars in North America. A bunch of other cars using CCS just Teslas use NACS. And so, yeah. So Ford's like, yeah, we kind of just want to jump on this supercharger network. I'm sure some money exchanged hands. I don't know the details of how this worked out, but this collab, I think is a win for Ford EV buyers. 100%. It's a win for Ford because it makes all of the EVs much more compelling. I think the Mach-E is about as close to a model Y equivalent as you could possibly get at this point. And F-150 Lightning now is way more road trippable. Like I could happily road trip being able to Tesla supercharge in an F-150 Lightning. So yeah, that's a win as far as they're concerned. I think you can only consider it an L if you are a Tesla driver who's already experiencing really high wait times or busy superchargers. And that's about it. That's the only thing, like, that's the only downside. I see if this is like, I will wait for the day when people are going to be like, I'm mad at Tesla because now all these other cars are at my charger and I'm waiting in long lines. I think on the East Coast, that's not that big of an issue. On the West Coast, there are some pretty long waits, but overall, this is a huge win. I also think it is really cool because the main announcement was like 2025 Ford adapting an ACS. But they said as early as next year, 12,000 superchargers in US and Canada will have the software integration to allow all the Ford cars. And I'm assuming we get an adapter at that point. Yeah, 12,000. And I just wonder here, anything before next year, will Ford sell the adapter to these people? I'm sure they'll have some sort of software update because there's no way they're going to leave behind the 2022, 2023 mockeys in the 1950s. Yeah, I think all those people get this update as well. Yeah, for 12,000. It was funny because when we did that video charging the Rivian on the Tesla supercharger, it was one of like five chargers in the US that got enabled with this dock. And you have to have the Tesla app and use the adapter. But yeah, this is specifically like, all right, you've got the Ford, it will work. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. I have mixed feelings about this. As someone who personally experienced the terrors of CCS road tripping in the mockey from Ford. Yeah, that's right. It was the mockey. And got not enough sleep because of it. That sounds great. I mean, if we had done this road trip and our mockey had the Tesla supercharger, we probably would have gotten there at about the same time as you guys. If you guys haven't seen that, it's on the studio channel. It's called the. That was just my little race. I think ours might have just been like road trip vlog for studio. Yeah, we did a road trip between a long range gas car, the longest range Tesla and the longest range. Non Tesla at the time, which was the mockey. Brandon and I got there 13 hours later. Anyway, there is. Yeah, I feel mixed on this because it's great. The supercharger network is already massive, but the US in general is also spending tons of money to expand CCS. And there's been such a long period of time when everyone's been trying to decide, okay, what is the standard? What is the standard? What is the standard? Because if you go to a gas station, sure, there's like diesel, whatever, whatever, but it's all the same type of pump. It doesn't really matter like what's on the inside. As long as the connector is the same, that's all that really matters. And having these two competing ones is kind of weird now because Ford makes the most popular car in the US like that of 150, right? Yep. So if you have like Tesla and Ford that have the Tesla charger and then you have everyone else on CCS, it's just going to like create this awkward separation. And then there's the whole thing where in the EU, Tesla has to use CCS. So it just feels like a standard mess. And I was kind of hoping that Tesla eventually just switched back to CCS and retrofitted all of its superchargers with magic adapters. Here's the thing about that. The NACS connector is better. And that's the... It is better. It's so much smaller. It's smaller. It's smaller. Thin cable, super fast. And like they've built the whole network. They spent all those billions of dollars in the US to like optimize this. We've got 250 kilowatt chargers and that thin cable plugging it right in. And that's so well done in the US that the only reason they do it in Europe is because they had to. I'm sure they would love to also do NACS everywhere. It does. Why? Like I know that Elon was trying to make NACS the standard and it just didn't happen. Do you know why it didn't happen? I don't know exactly. I'd have to look up the details, but I'm pretty sure that they were forced to use CCS. Because it was called NACS. Can't use that. You're up. Can't use that in Europe. Well even in the US, right? Like the Biden administration just put like a ton of money into developing chargers throughout the United States, but I'm pretty sure it's mostly CCS chargers. It's... Well, it had to be, I believe in that bill, it had to... The charging network had to be able to use more than a single company's worth of electric vehicles, which I think is why we saw that pushed to the... What's the like magic adapter or whatever? Like the magic dock. So like this feels like maybe potentially on that. I do think one thing here that's a little different and not as bad in terms of standards is like Tesla's all come with an adapter for CCS no matter what, right? No, they did. They're until 2022. Now they charge you? They charge you for CCS. Yeah, you doesn't come with it anymore. Well, I guess we're going to turn into this point of are you going to start getting charged for that or is it going to come with your car? Because it does seem like the software enabling is what was blocking CCS from using or non-Tesla chargers from having some sort of an adapter. Like I don't think there was any hardware difficulties of creating the adapter. I'm sure someone could have done it, but software was limiting it. I don't think adapting both ways is going to be that hard. And like if we see this magic dock, they're obviously opening it up for more people. So that will be open for other sides. And then also Ford and Tesla's can still go use Electrify America or any of those as well. Yeah. I guess I'm just worried about my mom. You know, how is my mom going to know what to do? I mean, you're not raw. Yeah, it's totally fair. That's my main concern. Yeah. I hope they make it really easy. Like with the Rivian, they gave us software updates. Now you can see this compatible chargers and they include the Tesla superchargers. But there's still a process of like, well, you have to have the Tesla app and a Tesla account and then enable it in the Tesla, all that stuff. Yeah. Ideally, they make this easy with software, but that's not really up to them. So we'll see. Yeah. Thanks for watching this clip. My name is Marquez Brownlee. Why is the background white?
