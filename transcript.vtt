WEBVTT

00:01.290 --> 00:04.810
Okay. Today I want to talk about AJ.

00:04.890 --> 00:08.394
Piplica. Who's the founder and CEO of Hermes,

00:08.522 --> 00:11.886
a tech startup. A deep tech startup that's building a

00:11.908 --> 00:15.358
hypersonic aircraft. It's a fascinating company.

00:15.524 --> 00:19.594
And I actually first met him on Twitter. I had made this joke

00:19.722 --> 00:23.454
about how if I were president for a day and I had complete control over,

00:23.492 --> 00:27.394
the government would recommission the SR

00:27.442 --> 00:31.346
71, the famous supersonic plane that was designed

00:31.378 --> 00:34.966
by Lockheed Martin Skunkworks and has been out of commission for

00:34.988 --> 00:38.906
a few decades now. And the reason was that I thought

00:39.008 --> 00:42.458
that bringing the plane back would send an amazing message

00:42.624 --> 00:46.042
to the world that America just takes

00:46.096 --> 00:49.766
being in person super seriously. So the queen had recently

00:49.798 --> 00:53.262
died, and it would have just been so badass in my mind if

00:53.316 --> 00:56.698
the American president could have hopped on a supersonic plane

00:56.794 --> 01:00.670
and been in London paying his respects 90

01:00.740 --> 01:04.274
minutes after the news broke instead of a few days later when

01:04.392 --> 01:08.258
Air Force One can kind of make a proper

01:08.344 --> 01:11.934
trip. And so I had tweeted this joke

01:11.982 --> 01:15.950
out and AJ. Replied and was like, I'm going to make that a reality.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.178
I was like, okay. Yeah, he's got this company. He's got some cool renders.

01:20.354 --> 01:23.814
Who knows if he's actually going to do it. But I

01:23.852 --> 01:27.238
recently toured their facility, and it's very, very real.

01:27.324 --> 01:30.826
He is absolutely building a hypersonic aircraft. And I

01:30.848 --> 01:34.874
believe he's going to do it. And he's actually tracking his progress to

01:34.992 --> 01:38.614
the speed at which Lockheed Martin Skunkworks Division built the SR

01:38.662 --> 01:42.358
71. And he's trying to build a plane faster than

01:42.384 --> 01:47.630
they did, which is incredible because it's one of, like, the historical incredible

01:47.970 --> 01:51.726
projects like the Manhattan Project that just happened so quickly. And we

01:51.748 --> 01:55.394
don't really see that in government projects. Everything goes over budget and over

01:55.432 --> 01:59.460
time, and he's trying to bring that back. And it's really, really exciting to

02:00.710 --> 02:03.906
you know, I've toured the facility. I spent a full day there

02:03.928 --> 02:07.554
in Atlanta, and I met with all the co founders, saw everything

02:07.592 --> 02:10.934
in facility, and it was just a fascinating experience. So I'm excited to

02:11.052 --> 02:14.262
tell you about it. And I've actually done a few videos on YouTube about

02:14.396 --> 02:17.606
supersonic technology in the past. One was about

02:17.628 --> 02:20.850
the SR 71, and then the other one was about this company, Boom, which is

02:20.860 --> 02:24.470
a Y combinator company. They've raised a bunch of money and they're making a supersonic

02:24.550 --> 02:28.282
jetliner for commercial air flight. And it's a very, very different

02:28.336 --> 02:31.546
approach. Boom. As you'll see with the story. Like they're going

02:31.648 --> 02:34.958
non military. Pure commercial. They're building a lot of stuff themselves.

02:35.044 --> 02:38.494
It's very capital intensive. And Hermes and AJ. Have just taken a completely

02:38.532 --> 02:42.142
different approach, so it's definitely worth diving into. I want both companies

02:42.196 --> 02:45.426
to succeed genuinely, just because it'd be really cool to be able to fly from

02:45.448 --> 02:49.134
New York to London in 90 minutes. And It Would Also be Great if America

02:49.182 --> 02:52.946
Could solve the hypersonic vehicle problem and have that

02:52.968 --> 02:56.722
technology defending us. But I

02:56.776 --> 03:00.418
like how Hermes has kind of decomposed the problem on their side, as you'll

03:00.434 --> 03:04.082
see. So let's go into kind of why this matters.

03:04.146 --> 03:07.554
So the first thing is that the race for hypersonic weapons

03:07.602 --> 03:10.986
is super, super real right now. A lot of know it

03:11.008 --> 03:14.538
just gets lost in the headlines about Russia, China, Ukraine, Taiwan. There's all

03:14.544 --> 03:18.042
these different headlines going on, all these different geopolitical things.

03:18.176 --> 03:21.786
But hypersonic weapons are a really big deal, and I'll

03:21.818 --> 03:25.290
explain why. So we actually have hypersonic weapons.

03:25.450 --> 03:29.214
They're just rocket powered. So any ICBM is

03:29.252 --> 03:31.360
hypersonic. They travel at like, Mach 15,

03:32.050 --> 03:35.426
and every SpaceX rocket that goes into orbit goes

03:35.528 --> 03:39.042
well past hypersonic. And there isn't actually a true

03:39.096 --> 03:43.202
hypersonic barrier. There's a supersonic barrier, which is very much

03:43.256 --> 03:46.290
defined by physics. It's the point at which there's a sonic boom.

03:46.950 --> 03:50.742
And so it's very, very hard to get past that. But with hypersonics, that happens

03:50.796 --> 03:54.514
around mach five. But it isn't a very specific binary

03:54.562 --> 03:58.294
moment. It's just a moment where you're going so fast that the air chemistry around

03:58.332 --> 04:01.610
the vehicle changes. So there's a whole bunch of new problems

04:01.680 --> 04:05.046
that you need to solve as an aircraft designer. And it's something that's really held

04:05.078 --> 04:08.246
the technology back. It works very well on missiles,

04:08.438 --> 04:12.166
where you're sending off a rocket and you don't really care that it's

04:12.198 --> 04:15.454
going to come back because it's going to crash into your target. But in terms

04:15.492 --> 04:19.680
of reusable craft, which is obviously the future, hypersonic has been

04:20.210 --> 04:24.034
a real tough thing to solve. And the fear is

04:24.072 --> 04:28.158
that China is developing hypersonic

04:28.174 --> 04:31.678
missiles in Russia as well. And these hypersonic missiles can potentially carry

04:31.694 --> 04:35.298
a nuclear warhead or potentially take out an aircraft carrier. And that creates kind of

04:35.304 --> 04:38.806
a zone of defense around China that won't allow

04:38.988 --> 04:42.838
our aircraft carriers to maneuver into position. And if you

04:42.844 --> 04:46.082
remember, during the Taiwan strait cris, we actually brought

04:46.146 --> 04:49.810
two aircraft carrier groups into the Taiwan strait to kind of defend Taiwan.

04:49.890 --> 04:53.110
And if China has hypersonic missiles, we wouldn't be able to do that. And that's

04:53.610 --> 04:57.530
a big problem. And now the reason that hypersonic missiles and hypersonic weapons are so

04:57.600 --> 05:00.858
important is because it kind of splits the difference between what you get with an

05:00.864 --> 05:04.182
ICBM, which is really, really fast, but ultimately very predictable,

05:04.246 --> 05:07.594
because you're launching this rocket, it shoots off from the ground,

05:07.642 --> 05:11.018
and it's on a parabolic curve, and you can kind of intercept it very easily.

05:11.114 --> 05:14.482
On the flip side, you have a cruise missile which is

05:14.536 --> 05:18.706
targeted with a turbofan. It's basically like a fighter jet, and that

05:18.728 --> 05:22.382
means it's very maneuverable. If you've seen the old James Bond

05:22.446 --> 05:25.858
GoldenEye, I think it's GoldenEye. There's this moment where

05:25.864 --> 05:28.706
they fire off the cruise missile, and it's like flying through the canyons, and it's

05:28.728 --> 05:32.306
evading defenses. It's going very low and it's very unpredictable. So it's hard to shoot

05:32.338 --> 05:36.146
down, but it's ultimately slow so it can be shot down. And we have systems

05:36.178 --> 05:39.790
for that. But no one can shoot down a hypersonic missile

05:39.810 --> 05:43.398
at this point because it goes so fast, mach Five, and it's also maneuverable.

05:43.494 --> 05:47.590
So blending those two things together is really, really valuable.

05:47.670 --> 05:51.338
Now, Hermes isn't building hypersonic missiles. They're building hypersonic aircraft.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.894
And so that has a number of different applications. The first

05:54.932 --> 05:59.002
is ISR or intelligence surveillance and Reconnaissance,

05:59.146 --> 06:02.654
which is basically cameras and sensors on a plane. And this

06:02.692 --> 06:06.194
will allow the Hermes craft to kind of get

06:06.232 --> 06:09.550
into enemy airspace and take photos and do reconnaissance

06:09.630 --> 06:13.138
without getting shot down because it's traveling so fast. But it's also not

06:13.304 --> 06:16.766
predictable, the trajectory. And then ultimately,

06:16.798 --> 06:20.806
they do want to turn into a weapons platform and deploy drop bombs or

06:20.828 --> 06:23.926
drop missiles from it. And then ultimately, in the long,

06:23.948 --> 06:26.978
long term, they want to be able to carry people because obviously that would unlock

06:26.994 --> 06:30.738
a ton of really interesting applications. So the

06:30.764 --> 06:34.490
government has been working on this for a very long time. There's the SR 72,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.826
which is Lockheed's successor to the SR 71. That program,

06:39.008 --> 06:42.326
it was made public and then it was made private again when the stakes

06:42.358 --> 06:45.706
got raised and people started worrying about the hypersonic

06:45.738 --> 06:49.294
race really heating up. So we don't know that much about the SR 72

06:49.332 --> 06:52.794
project. But then there's also the Air Force's Mayhem

06:52.842 --> 06:56.174
project, which is another hypersonic program.

06:56.292 --> 07:00.142
And so Hermes is in kind of a very exciting

07:00.206 --> 07:03.714
space. But they're really the main startup that's really trying

07:03.752 --> 07:07.374
to go after this problem with kind of that startup mentality, really quick iteration.

07:07.422 --> 07:11.142
And we'll kind of get into their process of how they have

07:11.196 --> 07:14.710
solved some of the really hard problems to be able to iterate on this problem

07:14.780 --> 07:18.486
really quickly. And so the other

07:18.508 --> 07:22.060
point is that it's just an interesting company. They've raised $100 million from really cool

07:22.430 --> 07:26.058
investors. Kosla did their first round. Canaan did

07:26.064 --> 07:28.986
their second round. And then Sam Altman did their third round. And Founders Fund is

07:29.008 --> 07:32.826
also invested. So obviously I'm interested. And it's always

07:32.848 --> 07:35.646
good to see Sam Altman investing in something other than AI. Because it means that

07:35.668 --> 07:38.510
he doesn't just think that AI. Is going to dominate everything.

07:38.660 --> 07:42.522
He thinks that in the future, there will be a need for hypersonic aircraft,

07:42.586 --> 07:45.760
which I love to hear. So let's go into the background on,

07:46.710 --> 07:49.822
you know, he's born in Port Chester, New York, but he moves to South Florida

07:49.886 --> 07:52.866
in his early childhood. He loves Star Trek as a kid,

07:52.968 --> 07:56.838
and specifically, he loves that in Star Trek, most of the

07:56.844 --> 08:01.218
stories are driven by super, super fast vehicles.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.742
So all of the narratives revolve around going from one place to another

08:04.796 --> 08:09.094
extremely quickly. And so he develops this love of high

08:09.132 --> 08:12.266
speed aircraft very early. And then he also goes to an air

08:12.288 --> 08:15.706
show, and he sees a massive C Five aircraft, which is like one of the

08:15.728 --> 08:19.178
biggest cargo planes that's used by the military and he

08:19.184 --> 08:23.018
gets fascinated with this. And so he winds up going to study

08:23.184 --> 08:27.386
engineering at Georgia tech. He gets a bachelor's and a master's. He studied aerodynamics

08:27.418 --> 08:30.960
and fluid mechanics, which are like perfect for what he does because obviously

08:31.410 --> 08:34.834
you need really good aerodynamics to go mach five. And then when you're going

08:34.872 --> 08:38.546
mach five, fluid dynamics comes into it because the air chemistry is

08:38.568 --> 08:41.934
actually changing around the vehicle. So he kind of has the perfect background

08:41.982 --> 08:45.620
for hypersonic technology. And then

08:46.470 --> 08:49.666
he gets his first job. He works at NASA, the Johnson

08:49.698 --> 08:53.880
space center. But he gets his first job in this really weird way where

08:54.250 --> 08:57.826
his parents had gone to a talk that was hosted

08:57.858 --> 09:01.606
by Bill Nye, the science guy. And while they're

09:01.638 --> 09:05.002
there, they meet the CEO of this small aerospace company called

09:05.056 --> 09:08.582
spaceworks that's based in Atlanta. And the CEO,

09:08.726 --> 09:11.802
they tell the CEO, hey, we have this son who's really interested

09:11.856 --> 09:15.166
in aerospace. And he's like, whoa, well you should tell him

09:15.188 --> 09:18.762
to apply for an internship. So AJ does, and he gets an internship

09:18.826 --> 09:22.334
and he starts working at this company. He works his way up from intern to

09:22.372 --> 09:26.174
eventually becoming the CEO of a full subsidiary. It's a really fascinating

09:26.222 --> 09:29.358
rise. He just like rocket trajectory, no pun

09:29.374 --> 09:33.074
intended. And so he's an intern. And then he goes

09:33.112 --> 09:36.738
part time while he's in school. And after he graduates, he goes full time at

09:36.824 --> 09:40.994
spaceworks. And then Spaceworks creates a subsidiary called generation

09:41.042 --> 09:44.678
orbit, or Go, which is what the guys refer to it as.

09:44.764 --> 09:48.690
And the idea with this subsidiary was that they were going to create a hypersonic

09:48.770 --> 09:52.234
launch vehicle for small satellites. So if you remember

09:52.272 --> 09:55.866
back in 2013, 2015, there was

09:55.888 --> 09:59.606
a big kind of hype cycle almost around small satellites.

09:59.638 --> 10:03.270
So that's what SpaceX and Starlink became.

10:03.350 --> 10:05.950
You put up a bunch of these communication satellites and then you can do interesting

10:06.020 --> 10:09.914
things, whether that's in flight wi fi, or wireless

10:09.962 --> 10:13.486
in remote areas, there's a bunch of different applications. And then obviously

10:13.668 --> 10:17.394
there's military contracts as well. And so he is

10:17.512 --> 10:20.946
building this team out. He comes and joins as, he technically joined as

10:20.968 --> 10:24.814
the COO of the subsidiary. But then he got promoted to COO.

10:24.862 --> 10:28.278
And he basically builds out this whole team, hires a bunch of people.

10:28.364 --> 10:32.230
And the four key people that he hires at this company

10:32.380 --> 10:35.990
become all of his co founders at Hermes. And there's a very interesting

10:36.060 --> 10:39.974
kind of trajectory there. So they wind up building this

10:40.012 --> 10:43.706
thing. It's basically a ramjet, but it's air launched. So the

10:43.728 --> 10:46.998
big problem with ramjets, which is really the core technology that unlocks

10:47.014 --> 10:50.294
hypersonic flight, is that you need to get them up to speed.

10:50.342 --> 10:53.430
You can't start them on the ground like you can with a turbo fan.

10:53.510 --> 10:57.086
So a normal jet engine that you see in a fighter jet that

10:57.108 --> 11:00.826
takes off from an aircraft carrier, you spin up that engine and it just slowly

11:00.858 --> 11:04.686
starts producing more and more power until you're able to just take off and

11:04.708 --> 11:08.178
then you can go really, really fast. You can go Mach One, Mach Two,

11:08.264 --> 11:12.274
but those tend to cap out, and you can't push a turbofan to Mach

11:12.312 --> 11:16.190
Five, where the air chemistry changes, the air starts getting compressed by the shockwaves.

11:16.270 --> 11:19.846
It gets really, really complicated. Basically what they

11:19.868 --> 11:22.390
would do is they would fly up in a plane and then they would launch

11:23.130 --> 11:26.854
the Ramjet, which would then push the small satellite into

11:26.892 --> 11:30.518
orbit. And this was kind of the idea. There's been a bunch

11:30.534 --> 11:34.186
of different approaches to launching small satellites, but that's what he was

11:34.208 --> 11:37.830
doing. He's getting all this hypersonic

11:37.910 --> 11:41.786
experience, but he realizes that he wants to go bigger. And it seems like

11:41.888 --> 11:45.422
he basically built this amazing co founding team, but they

11:45.476 --> 11:49.002
didn't really have support from the ownership because they're this subsidiary

11:49.066 --> 11:53.002
and they're kind of operating as a startup, but they probably didn't have equity

11:53.066 --> 11:56.206
like a normal startup. And it was kind of and they probably didn't have all

11:56.228 --> 12:00.254
the decision making authority and they clearly had the skill sets. So eventually

12:00.302 --> 12:03.650
they break off. And it's kind of unclear how rough of an experience

12:03.720 --> 12:07.890
that was, but I get the feeling that it definitely shaped AJ's

12:08.050 --> 12:12.086
worldview and his drive. Like he wants to make this thing a success

12:12.188 --> 12:16.310
because of his experience in that kind of subsidiary world.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.686
And now he really owns his own destiny and that's very satisfying to him.

12:19.788 --> 12:23.146
So he puts together this team. While he's there, he gets this

12:23.168 --> 12:26.346
guy Glenn from Blue Origin Skyler, who interned at

12:26.368 --> 12:30.618
SpaceX. And then he eventually hires this guy Mike, who is a PhD and

12:30.704 --> 12:35.338
also worked at SpaceX. So he has this really, really solid team in aerospace.

12:35.514 --> 12:38.910
And they'd won some contracts with the government

12:38.980 --> 12:42.606
and NASA and DoD, and they spent three

12:42.628 --> 12:46.594
years working together. But then they eventually break off. And so when

12:46.632 --> 12:50.674
they break off, they have this great founding team. But they're all engineers and

12:50.712 --> 12:54.414
so they're not these financial shark

12:54.462 --> 12:58.366
guys who can go out and raise money on a pitch deck and a render

12:58.478 --> 13:01.702
overnight and just put together a massive funding round like a lot of people could

13:01.756 --> 13:05.080
during the boom. This was around 2018 when they started the company.

13:05.690 --> 13:09.522
So they're having a lot of trouble pitching the company. They apply to YC,

13:09.666 --> 13:14.246
and in a really weird thing, YC doesn't do second round interviews.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.446
They read your application, they do a 15 minutes interview

13:17.558 --> 13:20.346
and then they tell you they call you and tell you you got it.

13:20.368 --> 13:23.434
Or they send you an email and say, sorry, you didn't get it. But with

13:23.472 --> 13:27.022
Hermes, they actually gave them a second phone call and talked to them more

13:27.076 --> 13:29.726
and then decided that they didn't get the company. And this is like a really

13:29.748 --> 13:33.466
rough setback because obviously YC had funded

13:33.498 --> 13:36.782
Boom and it seemed like a cool would be a good

13:36.836 --> 13:40.162
fit, but the team didn't take it too hard. They just realized that

13:40.216 --> 13:43.186
they needed some people to help them pitch the company. So they put together this

13:43.288 --> 13:46.174
board of advisors of kind of more experienced,

13:46.302 --> 13:49.942
more reputable people who can kind of lend their credibility and this

13:49.996 --> 13:53.494
board of advisors kind of helps them kind of get the round together.

13:53.612 --> 13:57.046
They get really, really far with one VC who

13:57.068 --> 14:00.326
they didn't tell me the name but they were like

14:00.348 --> 14:03.786
clearly at the term sheet stage or in due diligence and at

14:03.808 --> 14:07.482
the last second they basically get rugged and the deal

14:07.536 --> 14:10.714
falls through. And they're all crushed because when the guys started the company

14:10.832 --> 14:14.518
they basically had all saved up enough money to live for six months

14:14.624 --> 14:18.138
on their personal burn rates. But if the company didn't

14:18.154 --> 14:20.954
get funding after six months they were going to have to get other jobs.

14:21.002 --> 14:24.286
Like the momentum was going to stall. It probably wouldn't have

14:24.308 --> 14:27.762
worked out. So they're getting really close to this and they

14:27.816 --> 14:31.026
lose the deal and so they all just kind of

14:31.048 --> 14:35.022
like take a day off and they go and work on basically the stupidest

14:35.086 --> 14:38.350
business ideas I've ever heard. And I think that they would agree that

14:38.360 --> 14:41.826
they were really dumb. Like, one guy goes off and builds

14:41.858 --> 14:45.830
a business plan to try and create a party bus that

14:45.900 --> 14:50.290
has a hot tub in it, and he's solving all these complex physics equations

14:50.370 --> 14:53.606
to see how the water would slosh around. It's like really, really silly

14:53.638 --> 14:57.178
stuff, but it scratches that itch for just, like, a really

14:57.264 --> 15:00.566
ridiculous problem that you can bring an engineering mindset

15:00.598 --> 15:04.966
to. They basically do a hackathon. And AJ goes off and thinks about selling Hamon

15:04.998 --> 15:08.414
Aberico, which is like this meat. I'd never even heard of it, but he's thinking

15:08.452 --> 15:12.014
about buying this meat and selling it on the street kind of directly to people

15:12.052 --> 15:16.046
because he found out that it has really high margins, and they're basically just

15:16.068 --> 15:19.554
in the lowest of lows. But then they get an email from

15:19.592 --> 15:23.074
Kosala Ventures who they had sent a pitch deck to and never really heard

15:23.112 --> 15:26.594
from a couple of months earlier. And Vinod Kosla wants to meet with them

15:26.632 --> 15:30.366
and another one of the partners, Sven, brings them in and they'd

15:30.398 --> 15:32.818
give this pitch and at the time they were just doing like a precede,

15:32.834 --> 15:36.006
like going to YC they only needed like 100K. Just kind of keep the

15:36.028 --> 15:39.666
lights on. Maybe don't even start building an engine because that'd

15:39.698 --> 15:43.578
be really expensive. Maybe just work on the pitch deck the story,

15:43.744 --> 15:47.398
get some spreadsheets together and then go raise like a real seed round.

15:47.494 --> 15:51.274
But Kosla is liking it so they kind of size up their ask in

15:51.312 --> 15:54.570
mid meeting. They're kind of like, yeah, we could definitely put a million or two

15:54.640 --> 15:57.214
to work. So they get their seed round done, I think it's a couple million

15:57.252 --> 16:00.750
bucks and that lets them go and build their first engine.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.474
And this starts kind of the cycle for Hermes,

16:04.522 --> 16:07.906
which is when you're doing this really hard deep tech

16:08.088 --> 16:11.826
problem, you can't just go straight to the finish line and try

16:11.848 --> 16:15.426
and build the hypersonic aircraft that has ISR capabilities and

16:15.448 --> 16:18.818
weapons on board and can defeat China. That's way too tall

16:18.834 --> 16:22.438
of an order. There's just too many unknowns. It's too capital intensive and

16:22.444 --> 16:26.582
there's way too much risk. So instead, they focus

16:26.636 --> 16:30.022
on this very broken up Iterative approach. So they basically

16:30.156 --> 16:33.754
raise money and then they build an engine. Then they go and

16:33.792 --> 16:37.526
test it. And we'll get into testing. It's crazy how complicated testing

16:37.558 --> 16:41.750
is for this company. And then they get a contract with government, which proves revenue

16:41.830 --> 16:45.598
or like, demand, and then they go and raise more, and then they've just kind

16:45.604 --> 16:49.118
of iterated on this basically every year. And that's allowed them to solve some

16:49.124 --> 16:52.750
of the really hard problems with working with the government and the DoD.

16:53.190 --> 16:56.466
And so they get the money from

16:56.568 --> 17:00.306
Kosla and

17:00.328 --> 17:04.162
then they start building their first engine. So they basically built

17:04.216 --> 17:08.546
this, I saw as a very rudimentary turbojet

17:08.738 --> 17:12.454
that spins up and provides some propellant into

17:12.492 --> 17:16.118
the Ramjet and then at a certain point flips over and then you're using the

17:16.124 --> 17:19.266
Ramjet power. And that's kind of the whole model.

17:19.388 --> 17:23.094
They're now building what's called the Chimera engine because obviously Chimera

17:23.142 --> 17:26.890
is like two things melded together and that

17:26.960 --> 17:30.650
really unlocks their ability to go both take off from the ground and

17:30.720 --> 17:34.494
go slow, but then also go really, really fast once the Ramjet kicks on.

17:34.612 --> 17:38.126
And so they get through this, they go and they

17:38.148 --> 17:41.294
build the first engine. And then they have to go and test it.

17:41.332 --> 17:44.994
And there's only like one or two wind

17:45.032 --> 17:48.386
tunnels that can actually test hypersonic engines that

17:48.408 --> 17:51.938
are publicly available. Or you can just they have capacity. There are

17:51.944 --> 17:55.026
probably some private ones, but startups don't have access to

17:55.048 --> 17:59.750
those. And I actually talked to this defense journalist, Alex Hollings,

18:00.730 --> 18:04.566
and I asked him if there was one thing that you could do if

18:04.588 --> 18:08.482
you were the President for a day, what would you do to help

18:08.556 --> 18:12.454
America win the race for hypersonic weaponry?

18:12.582 --> 18:17.222
And I was expecting him to, you know, pump some money into grants,

18:17.366 --> 18:20.670
know, accelerate this project or that project. And he told me, no,

18:20.740 --> 18:24.206
the one thing that the government needs to do is have more

18:24.308 --> 18:27.482
hypersonic testing tunnels built at various

18:27.546 --> 18:31.514
academic institutions and research facilities because that's

18:31.562 --> 18:35.754
truly where the key bottleneck

18:35.802 --> 18:39.282
is right now, in hypersonic research. So the guys drive

18:39.336 --> 18:43.058
their engine up to Indiana. I think they went to Notre Dame, where they

18:43.064 --> 18:46.274
have the tunnel, and they test it and it works, and they get good data

18:46.312 --> 18:49.766
and they prove that this idea of running the

18:49.788 --> 18:54.066
turbojet engine and then switching over to the Ramjet at a certain speed,

18:54.178 --> 18:57.910
it will work. And so that unlocks their Series A and then

18:58.060 --> 19:00.390
they get that done with Canaan.

19:02.810 --> 19:06.650
It's really funny about Ramjets everyone I've talked to who's technical in

19:06.720 --> 19:09.986
the defense tech hard tech world just loves

19:10.038 --> 19:13.658
Ramjets. There's this famous story about Palmer Lucky,

19:13.754 --> 19:17.294
where when Trey Stevens was pitching him the idea for

19:17.332 --> 19:20.990
Anderol, Palmer was already building a Ramjet

19:21.490 --> 19:25.406
in his swimming pool in Woodside, I think, and the neighbors were

19:25.428 --> 19:28.482
getting called, the cops were getting called because he's like building this crazy thing.

19:28.536 --> 19:31.726
But clearly every tinkerer loves Ramjets.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.806
And it's really cool to see Hermes finally trying to figure out how to commercialize

19:35.838 --> 19:39.654
these in a really serious way because it's a very old technology. But the

19:39.692 --> 19:42.790
real problem is not necessarily the

19:42.860 --> 19:46.134
tech risk here. And that's always kind of the best

19:46.332 --> 19:49.786
thing in defense tech startups is

19:49.808 --> 19:53.894
when they're not science projects, they're not trying to go off and invent

19:53.942 --> 19:57.690
an entirely new material or do fundamental material science research or

19:57.760 --> 20:01.450
have some fundamental breakthrough. It's more like the technology works.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.078
We just need to put it together in a different way. And then we need

20:04.084 --> 20:07.486
to solve all the hard steps of fundraising and then

20:07.588 --> 20:11.134
actually selling this into the military because that's obviously a really hard part.

20:11.252 --> 20:15.150
And so getting

20:15.220 --> 20:18.306
into the military and actually solving the Valley of

20:18.328 --> 20:22.290
Death is a theme that I've seen with all these companies. And so

20:22.360 --> 20:25.842
the way Hermes solved it was, first off, they hired this great guy from

20:25.896 --> 20:29.078
Anderol who had worked there and had a bunch of experience selling to the

20:29.084 --> 20:31.750
military. And then they really,

20:31.820 --> 20:35.026
really take a broad approach to what they're willing

20:35.058 --> 20:39.010
to do with government contracts. So their first contract,

20:39.090 --> 20:43.226
I believe, was to evaluate the viability of

20:43.248 --> 20:46.826
a hypersonic Air Force One. And I

20:46.848 --> 20:48.906
think they had a couple of million bucks in the bank. There was no way

20:48.928 --> 20:53.214
that they were going to promise to build a hypersonic Air Force One. But the

20:53.252 --> 20:56.954
fact that they were still able to get a contract

20:57.002 --> 21:00.382
and actually get some response from the government

21:00.436 --> 21:04.334
and get some buy in that, hey, we will actually

21:04.372 --> 21:07.906
give you money. There's now revenue on the books just to deliver kind

21:07.928 --> 21:11.266
of just a report and some data. And that's been some of

21:11.288 --> 21:14.626
the early projects. Everyone, obviously you want

21:14.648 --> 21:17.846
to drive to program of record where the military and

21:17.868 --> 21:21.698
the government is buying a capability on an ongoing basis. They're actually deploying

21:21.714 --> 21:25.698
it. It's having an impact. But with something that's as complicated as building a hypersonic

21:25.794 --> 21:29.574
aircraft, it's just not going to happen in year one or year two or

21:29.612 --> 21:33.434
even year three. So getting to the point, really understanding that

21:33.472 --> 21:37.078
and getting revenue on the books by doing these small programs

21:37.094 --> 21:40.534
where they can just turn over data or reports or just build one

21:40.592 --> 21:44.414
small piece for the government, but still satisfy and get good

21:44.452 --> 21:48.110
reviews and then get ready for the next contract, that's been a really

21:48.180 --> 21:52.270
big piece. And so one interesting

21:52.420 --> 21:56.286
learning, I mean, there's a bunch of interesting learnings, but one thing that they focused

21:56.318 --> 22:00.494
on throughout my conversation and my tour of the facility

22:00.622 --> 22:03.902
was the machine that builds the machine.

22:04.046 --> 22:08.002
So they're not just focused on building one aircraft,

22:08.066 --> 22:11.826
they really need to solve the entire supply chain

22:11.938 --> 22:15.698
and figure out how they can build an organization

22:15.794 --> 22:19.910
that produces these aircraft at scale

22:19.990 --> 22:23.578
in numbers pretty quickly. Because if it works,

22:23.744 --> 22:27.562
we know that the demand is know, russia and China are building

22:27.616 --> 22:31.354
a lot of these hypersonic weapons already. And so as soon as this

22:31.392 --> 22:34.270
thing is ready to go, the government will need a lot of them. And so

22:34.340 --> 22:37.566
hermes is going to need to solve their supply chain issues. So I think

22:37.588 --> 22:40.794
they got an investment from raytheon. And raytheon owns pratt and Whitney,

22:40.842 --> 22:44.298
which makes jet engines for American fightercraft.

22:44.394 --> 22:47.954
I think the f 22, it might be the f 16, but they've actually

22:47.992 --> 22:51.246
bought two of these huge pratt and whitney turbojet

22:51.278 --> 22:55.074
engines. And then they're going to basically take off

22:55.112 --> 22:58.694
the back, the afterburner of those

22:58.892 --> 23:02.034
jet engines and then attach their ram jets

23:02.082 --> 23:05.638
to them. And that will be the way that they build their engine.

23:05.724 --> 23:09.094
And it's very interesting because they're clearly obsessed with this idea of

23:09.132 --> 23:12.166
build versus buy. There's a lot that they still have to build. They're constantly,

23:12.198 --> 23:15.306
I mean, for the first version, I was

23:15.328 --> 23:19.034
talking to the co founder about how

23:19.072 --> 23:22.714
they were bending the pipes themselves and welding everything together themselves.

23:22.832 --> 23:26.894
And now they have really big 3D printing machines and all sorts of different ways

23:26.932 --> 23:30.302
to fabricate parts. But something as complicated as a jet engine,

23:30.356 --> 23:33.794
they're not going to be able to rebuild that internally, at least

23:33.832 --> 23:37.294
not anytime soon. So that's kind of why they've partnered and how they're

23:37.342 --> 23:40.978
thinking about building the machine that builds the

23:40.984 --> 23:44.562
machine. It's a really interesting phrase. And then

23:44.696 --> 23:48.434
that obviously really puts them in a different strategy

23:48.482 --> 23:52.130
as boom, which was originally, I think, partnered with rolls Royce

23:52.210 --> 23:55.654
to buy their engine. But then that didn't work

23:55.692 --> 23:58.954
out. I'm not exactly sure why. But now boom is trying to build

23:58.992 --> 24:02.022
a fully custom engine and it's going to be incredibly capital intensive.

24:02.166 --> 24:06.042
And the way boom is solving it is they're going off and getting

24:06.096 --> 24:10.614
money from the airlines

24:10.662 --> 24:14.238
and basically saying, hey, if you want access to

24:14.404 --> 24:18.010
supersonic aircraft on your most important flight routes,

24:18.090 --> 24:21.374
you better pony up and give us $200 million up front, or something

24:21.412 --> 24:23.360
like that. I don't exactly know the numbers,

24:25.110 --> 24:28.562
but for hermes, the government wants them

24:28.616 --> 24:31.778
to really bring this to market as fast as possible. And obviously they don't want

24:31.784 --> 24:35.818
to get stuck in the integration hell technical quagmire

24:35.854 --> 24:39.926
that might come with trying to build a turbojet or

24:39.948 --> 24:43.874
turbofan engine by themselves, especially when the off the shelf

24:43.922 --> 24:47.742
stuff works. And then the last thing that I noticed

24:47.826 --> 24:51.610
with hermes that's kind of very interesting

24:51.680 --> 24:55.802
and maybe under discussed is that even though they're all

24:55.856 --> 24:59.798
engineers and they had all this trouble pitching

24:59.814 --> 25:03.534
the company in the early days, but they're all really good

25:03.572 --> 25:07.198
at media now and I think they really understand the value of media. Even in

25:07.204 --> 25:09.950
a hard tech business where you're not selling to consumers,

25:10.370 --> 25:13.934
their customers, ultimately it's the government, at least

25:13.972 --> 25:18.386
for the next who knows how many years. But they

25:18.408 --> 25:21.746
have a podcast and they do a lot of media and they let YouTubers come

25:21.768 --> 25:25.026
in and tour it and make videos and stuff and they

25:25.048 --> 25:28.982
talk publicly about what they're building and I think that that

25:29.036 --> 25:32.278
really lets them solve. They're in Atlanta, they're going to need to

25:32.284 --> 25:35.462
pull people from all over the place to build this

25:35.516 --> 25:38.860
really solid engineering team. And so

25:39.550 --> 25:42.906
by having all of the co founders talk about the company culture, talk about

25:42.928 --> 25:45.500
the company evangelize for what they're doing,

25:45.950 --> 25:50.286
they're able to bring the

25:50.308 --> 25:53.806
customer is almost the employee. So they're able to recruit a bunch of people and

25:53.828 --> 25:57.102
then they're also able to have

25:57.156 --> 26:00.974
a really polished resource for

26:01.172 --> 26:05.114
the various politicians to get up to speed in Silicon

26:05.162 --> 26:08.434
Valley. I feel like everyone knows androol but

26:08.472 --> 26:11.826
I was talking to a congressman a couple months ago who had

26:11.848 --> 26:15.614
no idea what Androl was it just wasn't on his radar

26:15.662 --> 26:19.246
and he was telling me that he has defense

26:19.278 --> 26:22.486
budget to allocate and obviously anderol has

26:22.508 --> 26:26.066
like I think they have a hundred person team in Washington DC.

26:26.178 --> 26:29.914
Just to help sell to the government, educate people. But there's just the government's so

26:29.952 --> 26:33.366
big, there's hundreds of elected officials

26:33.398 --> 26:36.826
and then, like, thousands of people in the DoD that you might

26:36.848 --> 26:40.282
need to coordinate with. And so being able to tell

26:40.336 --> 26:43.878
your story, the Hermias team being able to

26:43.904 --> 26:47.454
tell their story is really, really important to get

26:47.572 --> 26:50.846
the important people and the key decision makers up to speed, to be able to

26:50.868 --> 26:54.330
make a decision on a contract very, very quickly and maybe decide to

26:54.340 --> 26:58.386
take a meeting that they wouldn't otherwise. And I think that's kind of a

26:58.408 --> 27:01.762
new era and obviously Palmer's leading the charge there.

27:01.816 --> 27:06.180
But there are obviously things that certain

27:07.350 --> 27:09.878
defense tech companies aren't going to be able to talk about. Even while I was

27:09.884 --> 27:13.318
there, there were obviously things that were classified and they couldn't talk about.

27:13.404 --> 27:17.094
But there's still so much cool stuff that they can talk about know?

27:17.132 --> 27:20.330
It's not just like the culture of their company in Atlanta. It's also just like

27:20.400 --> 27:24.810
the history of this technology and why it's important the geopolitical implications,

27:25.390 --> 27:28.906
their fundraising story and what they're actually building. A lot of

27:28.928 --> 27:33.040
that isn't classified. Maybe the more minut details are,

27:33.810 --> 27:38.334
but I was just very surprised that they were

27:38.372 --> 27:41.726
so open and are so capable of

27:41.748 --> 27:45.534
telling their story and really articulating why

27:45.572 --> 27:48.974
this is such an important thing. So yeah,

27:49.012 --> 27:53.134
that's the story of Hermes. I'm going to do a bigger video on this and

27:53.172 --> 27:56.246
cut together a bunch of the interview footage that I got while I

27:56.268 --> 27:58.534
was there. And yeah, I'm excited to share that with.
