00:00.250 --> 00:03.870
How much money do you make? What was it like meeting Elon Musk?

00:04.690 --> 00:08.158
Hey, welcome back to the Channel. Little bit of a different video today. I thought

00:08.164 --> 00:11.598
I'd do a Q and A. The channel's grown a ton, and I thought it'd

00:11.604 --> 00:14.894
be interesting just to answer some questions. So let's kick it off. Are you doing

00:14.932 --> 00:18.254
this unscripted video because you got COVID and you didn't have time

00:18.292 --> 00:22.126
to make a full video? That's ridiculous. I would I can't believe someone would

00:22.148 --> 00:25.526
ask that. Are you Tom Holland's older brother? I do get that

00:25.548 --> 00:28.754
a lot. No, I'm not related to him, but I think it's a compliment.

00:28.802 --> 00:31.714
He's a pretty talented guy. What is your educational background?

00:31.842 --> 00:35.366
So I grew up in Pasadena. I went to high school out here,

00:35.388 --> 00:38.834
and then I went to college in Boston. I studied economics

00:38.882 --> 00:42.454
at Northeastern University, and I thought I was going to go into finance,

00:42.582 --> 00:46.698
but in my junior and senior year, I started using Python to

00:46.784 --> 00:50.378
run some more complex economic models. Once Excel kind of

00:50.384 --> 00:53.966
topped out and I kind of saw how cool programming was, then I kind of

00:53.988 --> 00:57.610
shifted everything and went into startups. As soon as I graduated,

00:57.690 --> 01:01.210
I grabbed a friend from high school, moved to Silicon Valley,

01:01.290 --> 01:04.574
and kind of did the traditional startup school y combinator

01:04.622 --> 01:08.526
thing. No formal training in technology, really, or I didn't

01:08.558 --> 01:12.018
study computer science. I just kind of picked up software engineering and

01:12.024 --> 01:15.698
then eventually started programming full time, then ran a team.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.574
And now I don't program that much, but I still have software developers that

01:19.692 --> 01:23.074
report into me, and I feel comfortable managing software engineers

01:23.122 --> 01:26.982
since I do know enough about coding. That's kind of the second question here.

01:27.116 --> 01:31.174
Can you code? Yes. I definitely feel comfortable

01:31.222 --> 01:35.206
saying I can code. I'm not an amazing programmer or anything. I'm not developing entirely

01:35.238 --> 01:38.374
new algorithms. But I feel comfortable writing

01:38.422 --> 01:41.706
Python and getting what I need to get done on

01:41.728 --> 01:45.178
the Internet and building things. I know a little bit of JavaScript. I've messed

01:45.194 --> 01:48.574
around with closure to learn what a lisp is and how that

01:48.612 --> 01:52.042
works. And I've written some objective C for iOS, and I've touched

01:52.106 --> 01:55.294
most of the programming language a little bit. But Python's the one that I keep

01:55.332 --> 01:58.786
coming back to because it's so fun and so easy to use. Why did you

01:58.808 --> 02:02.530
leave Soyland? So Soylent was my first startup, was there from

02:02.600 --> 02:06.258
2012 till about 2016. 2017. Great experience.

02:06.344 --> 02:10.438
The company grew tremendously. We sold a ton of product,

02:10.604 --> 02:13.814
millions of dollars in sales the first month,

02:14.012 --> 02:17.574
and then just kind of grew from there. There were 50 people at the company

02:17.612 --> 02:20.918
when I left, and that's a big part of why I decided to move on

02:20.924 --> 02:23.706
and do a new startup. The company had grown so much, we were kind of

02:23.728 --> 02:27.542
out of that innovation mode, and we were more in execution.

02:27.606 --> 02:31.386
Let's just get the product into every store. Let's just

02:31.488 --> 02:34.474
distribute. Distribute. That's the name of the game. So we hired a bunch of people

02:34.512 --> 02:37.662
who know distribution really well and kind of let them take over.

02:37.716 --> 02:40.846
And then me and one of my co founders at Soylent and our

02:40.868 --> 02:43.934
creative director and our head of R and D were able to go and start

02:43.972 --> 02:47.626
this next company, Lucy, that helps people quit smoking. It sells nicotine

02:47.658 --> 02:51.106
products and that company was just not, that idea was not appropriate for

02:51.128 --> 02:53.586
the soil brand, so it had to be a different company. So we were able

02:53.608 --> 02:57.246
to step back and go build something new. It's always tough kind of leaving

02:57.358 --> 03:01.014
this family that you've built and stepping back from this whole team

03:01.052 --> 03:05.490
that you've built, but it's kind of a natural part of the startup lifecycle.

03:05.650 --> 03:08.758
How much money do you make? This is a very funny question.

03:08.844 --> 03:11.978
It's very gauche to ask, but on the internet when you put videos out,

03:12.064 --> 03:15.658
people naturally ask you this type of thing. So as an

03:15.664 --> 03:19.562
entrepreneur, I don't make a lot of money from my businesses because

03:19.696 --> 03:23.130
I am hoping to sell the business and then I have equity in the business,

03:23.200 --> 03:26.698
so I usually benchmark to what other startups are doing. And it's

03:26.714 --> 03:30.286
not a lot like pre series seed. Like when the

03:30.308 --> 03:33.278
company has not raised a lot of money, I might pay myself 60K, that's what

03:33.284 --> 03:36.766
I've paid myself in the past. Then post series seed,

03:36.878 --> 03:40.418
series A territory a little bit over.

03:40.424 --> 03:44.498
Then once the company is really growing, maybe two hundred k. But really every

03:44.664 --> 03:48.194
dollar that you pull out of the business while you're in that growth mode is

03:48.232 --> 03:51.862
a dollar that you could be spending on marketing or hiring someone or your product

03:51.916 --> 03:55.238
or engineering. So it's really risky to take too much money out

03:55.244 --> 03:58.150
of the business when you're still in that growth stage.

03:59.770 --> 04:03.122
The real benefit of all of this stuff is you want to

04:03.196 --> 04:06.026
sell the business for a lot of money and then you own equity. So the

04:06.048 --> 04:09.546
real question here, the better question is how much equity do you have

04:09.648 --> 04:13.326
in your companies? And I always try to find an

04:13.348 --> 04:16.714
even split between my co founders on the equity

04:16.762 --> 04:19.966
front, that's kind of best practice and that's what a lot of

04:19.988 --> 04:23.630
people in Silicon Valley preach. Doesn't always happen.

04:23.700 --> 04:27.038
Sometimes someone's worked a little bit harder, but in general that's kind of

04:27.124 --> 04:30.158
where I've worked to get to. What do you do in your free time?

04:30.324 --> 04:32.654
So I don't have a lot of free time because I have a full time

04:32.692 --> 04:35.718
job with my startup and then I have this YouTube channel and then I

04:35.724 --> 04:39.538
also have a ten month old son at home and he's

04:39.554 --> 04:42.486
obviously a lot of work. But when I do have free time, I mean,

04:42.508 --> 04:45.766
I love to read, I love to play video games, I love to listen to

04:45.788 --> 04:49.302
podcasts and kind of just research technologies and learn about

04:49.356 --> 04:52.810
things. But it's mostly a lot of work these days.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.262
Try and just kind of like, talk to people, have interesting conversations

04:56.326 --> 04:59.818
about technology in the future. That's like most of my free time. What are

04:59.824 --> 05:03.574
your favorite books? It's hard to name a specific favorite

05:03.622 --> 05:07.370
book, but I really liked Superfounders by Ali Tamasib.

05:07.450 --> 05:11.390
He's a venture capitalist and he crunched all this data about what makes

05:11.460 --> 05:14.766
a successful founder. Like a founder that creates a billion dollar

05:14.798 --> 05:18.882
company or bigger. It disproves a lot of misconceptions. It's very

05:18.936 --> 05:22.306
encouraging because kind of no matter what your background is,

05:22.408 --> 05:26.014
there's data that supports that you can be a massively successful

05:26.062 --> 05:29.906
founder. So it's very inspirational book, but also very data driven,

05:29.938 --> 05:33.474
which I really liked. And then I really enjoyed Tyler Cowen's stubborn

05:33.522 --> 05:36.918
attachments, which was published by Stripe Press, which is really cool.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.662
And it just kind of talks about how we should think about the modern

05:40.726 --> 05:44.502
economy and capitalism and economics

05:44.566 --> 05:48.246
from a very aspirational perspective.

05:48.278 --> 05:51.258
And it's just a great book. It's a very quick read as well.

05:51.344 --> 05:54.750
What YouTubers do you watch? This is a great question.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.606
I love corridor crew. I watch every single one of their videos. They're just

05:58.628 --> 06:02.334
incredible. I have played around with Visual effects. I know

06:02.372 --> 06:05.758
a little bit of After Effects in Cinema 4D, so I know the tools

06:05.774 --> 06:09.278
that they're using and it's just always really entertaining. Really great storytelling

06:09.294 --> 06:12.494
on that channel. Love them. Obviously watch. Like MKBHD.

06:12.622 --> 06:16.030
Obviously watch mr. Beast. Who doesn't? Smaller YouTubers.

06:16.110 --> 06:19.734
Obviously. Gary Tan is like the inspiration for my entire channel.

06:19.852 --> 06:23.734
I love what he does and I love him personally. And then I've been

06:23.772 --> 06:27.186
watching these interviews done by this guy, Jesse Michaels,

06:27.378 --> 06:31.078
that are just crazy. He interviews a lot of people about UFOs,

06:31.254 --> 06:34.394
but he also talks with crazy, really high profile tech people.

06:34.432 --> 06:37.962
He's super well connected in Silicon Valley, so I highly recommend his channel.

06:38.096 --> 06:42.214
And then I also like, g zero world. It's a bit more of a corporate

06:42.262 --> 06:45.978
channel, but it's run by this guy, Ian Bremmer. He's this political

06:46.074 --> 06:49.018
strategist. He's nonpartisan,

06:49.114 --> 06:52.014
but he's just trying to tell you what's going on in the world. And very,

06:52.052 --> 06:55.598
very informative videos, not clickbaity. He doesn't get a lot of views.

06:55.694 --> 06:59.614
But it's a really, really valuable channel if you're looking to understand kind of global

06:59.662 --> 07:03.902
politics, global economics in a way that's not controversial

07:03.966 --> 07:07.746
or like left wing or right wing. It's just here's

07:07.778 --> 07:11.446
what's actually happening in the world. So great channel. How do

07:11.468 --> 07:15.990
you make these videos? So I get this question a lot because

07:16.140 --> 07:19.654
it seems kind of crazy that someone could put out a video once

07:19.692 --> 07:22.266
a week and still have a full time job. So I have a team.

07:22.368 --> 07:26.250
I have a researcher who helps me write scripts and research

07:26.320 --> 07:29.638
facts and generate ideas. That's been really helpful.

07:29.734 --> 07:33.366
He doesn't help with every script, but on a few of them he's

07:33.398 --> 07:37.134
really, really nailed it. I use a teleprompter for most of these. That speeds things

07:37.172 --> 07:40.618
up. I typically write the scripts in Google Docs,

07:40.634 --> 07:43.262
and then I throw them up on the teleprompter, read them in there, and then

07:43.316 --> 07:46.770
I have a great editor who helps me combine everything

07:46.840 --> 07:50.018
and get all that great broll and add the music and kind of

07:50.104 --> 07:53.406
speed things up and clean up any mistakes. So that's

07:53.438 --> 07:56.898
been a huge benefit. Why did you start making YouTube videos?

07:57.064 --> 08:01.142
I love this question because it took me a long time to answer it myself.

08:01.276 --> 08:04.278
Basically, I was bored during the pandemic. I was locked down,

08:04.364 --> 08:08.278
didn't have anything to do. My wife was also pregnant, so I really had a

08:08.284 --> 08:11.238
lot of free time on my hands. For the first time in ten years of

08:11.244 --> 08:14.602
being an entrepreneur, all these cool people were hanging out in clubhouse, they were

08:14.656 --> 08:17.834
socializing. And I realized that I didn't really have a way to meet new

08:17.872 --> 08:20.810
people in technology, meet new founders, talk to people,

08:20.960 --> 08:25.034
and I was just kind of bored. So I decided to turn on the camera,

08:25.082 --> 08:28.682
start talking about things. The views started coming in. It was really, really positive.

08:28.746 --> 08:32.046
The comment section was always really, really positive. So I thought it was

08:32.068 --> 08:35.406
really cool. But now I'm thinking about it. Like, it's a great

08:35.428 --> 08:38.306
way to meet people. I think it's a great way to meet young founders that

08:38.328 --> 08:42.098
I can ultimately invest with or advise. I think

08:42.104 --> 08:45.458
it's just very important that we have more positive tech

08:45.544 --> 08:48.546
content on YouTube. If you look at a lot of the big tech channels,

08:48.578 --> 08:52.070
they're super negative. Every channel is like, theranos this,

08:52.140 --> 08:55.030
we work that. Like, blah, blah, blah. Every channel,

08:55.100 --> 08:57.826
everything's a scam, everything's a fraud.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.954
And that's true. There are some bad companies out there,

09:00.992 --> 09:04.394
but we don't need to highlight them 100%

09:04.432 --> 09:07.130
of the time. Obviously, the YouTube algorithm,

09:07.630 --> 09:11.306
it leans towards controversy. It loves controversy. People click on

09:11.328 --> 09:15.274
things that are scams and frauds and terrible destroyed the

09:15.312 --> 09:18.590
end of the world, like, very negative content. But I think it's really bad

09:18.660 --> 09:21.582
because I think there are problems in the world, and I think tech can be

09:21.636 --> 09:24.650
a solution to those problems in many, many situations.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.906
So I think we need more tech positive content, and that's a lot of what

09:27.928 --> 09:31.234
I'm trying to do with this channel. Will you invest in my company?

09:31.432 --> 09:34.814
Maybe it's happened. I've met a few people through YouTube

09:34.862 --> 09:38.626
that I've written angel checks into their companies. I don't

09:38.658 --> 09:42.310
do a ton of investing, but I like

09:42.380 --> 09:46.214
partnering with people that are super ambitious and working on really cool things. So if

09:46.252 --> 09:50.186
you want to pitch me, you can send me a brief description of what you're

09:50.208 --> 09:53.642
working on on Twitter. My DMs are open.

09:53.776 --> 09:57.178
You can also send me a deck or a doc or your website

09:57.264 --> 10:00.746
or something like that. Just don't ramble for a

10:00.768 --> 10:03.786
long time and try and tell me your whole life story,

10:03.888 --> 10:06.842
because it's really hard to respond to those types of messages.

10:06.986 --> 10:10.494
Now, I do think that you should be in a place where you are

10:10.612 --> 10:14.126
ready to take investment if you want to pitch me. Because a

10:14.148 --> 10:17.518
lot of people are still at the very early stages and they haven't really crystallized

10:17.614 --> 10:21.506
what the problem they're working on is, what the solution is. And you need

10:21.528 --> 10:24.834
to be able to tell if you have the

10:24.872 --> 10:28.410
skill set to go and build the solution that you're

10:28.430 --> 10:31.666
thinking of. Because I would love to build a time travel machine,

10:31.698 --> 10:35.206
but I have no experience in how to do

10:35.228 --> 10:38.866
that. So that would be a bad startup idea. Will you mentor me?

10:38.908 --> 10:42.154
I get this question a decent amount and the answer is

10:42.272 --> 10:44.700
probably not. Basically,

10:45.230 --> 10:48.374
I don't really do consulting, I don't really do mentorships.

10:48.422 --> 10:52.042
What I do is I invest in founders that are building companies.

10:52.176 --> 10:55.662
So if you're building a company and you think

10:55.716 --> 10:58.926
you'd like to work with me, reach out to me, we'll talk. And if I

10:58.948 --> 11:02.638
can invest, then I can mentor you for free. Actually, I'm giving you money and

11:02.644 --> 11:05.774
then you can call me whenever you want. But in terms of just

11:05.812 --> 11:09.026
like general mentorship, everything that I know I'm trying to put

11:09.048 --> 11:12.846
out on this channel for free, you can still ask me questions. You can DM

11:12.878 --> 11:16.306
me on Twitter and ask me a question. I might just answer it in

11:16.328 --> 11:20.214
a YouTube video instead of answering you directly. What technology

11:20.332 --> 11:23.494
are you most interested in right now? This is a good one.

11:23.532 --> 11:27.398
I got this after my 22 predictions of all the interesting

11:27.484 --> 11:31.106
tech in 2022. Basically, I think of there's three really

11:31.148 --> 11:35.290
interesting buckets that are going on right now. One is AI. Then there's space,

11:35.360 --> 11:38.854
like space travel, space exploration, everything that Elon's doing with SpaceX.

11:38.982 --> 11:42.870
And then there's crypto. And crypto obviously is like a huge trend.

11:43.030 --> 11:46.318
Everyone's talking about crypto. Out of those three buckets, I think they're all

11:46.324 --> 11:49.694
really interesting and I think they're all really impactful and important. But out of those

11:49.732 --> 11:53.246
three, AI is the one that is the most intriguing to me, just because

11:53.268 --> 11:56.642
that's the one that I've actually tinkered with. Like, I've written Python code

11:56.696 --> 12:00.526
that does AI stuff and I also can just immediately imagine

12:00.638 --> 12:04.082
how that's beneficial to me. Like, if I had a self driving car in my

12:04.136 --> 12:07.586
driveway, that would make my life better today. Whereas if

12:07.608 --> 12:11.266
you told me I could go to Mars, it'd be really, really cool. But that's

12:11.298 --> 12:14.790
a really harsh environment. I don't know that that's going to make my life better

12:14.860 --> 12:18.134
immediately. It's kind of unclear the value in the short

12:18.172 --> 12:21.626
term. And then with crypto, obviously you can make a ton of money, but there

12:21.648 --> 12:24.986
aren't that many people that are actually getting real tangible day

12:25.008 --> 12:28.550
to day value. They certainly are internationally.

12:28.710 --> 12:31.914
If you're in a country where there's a lot of hyperinflation, crypto can be great

12:31.952 --> 12:35.946
for you. Or if you're trying to transfer money across borders constantly

12:35.978 --> 12:40.330
and you need low fees, that's possible. Or if you're being deplatformed

12:40.410 --> 12:43.486
and you need a censorship resistant technology, like crypto could

12:43.508 --> 12:47.582
definitely deliver on that. But I'm in America, I'm not being deplatformed.

12:47.726 --> 12:50.542
I don't need to send money all over the world for really low fees.

12:50.606 --> 12:54.322
So all of the main crypto benefits to me aren't as

12:54.376 --> 12:57.806
impactful. It's cool that you could make money if you trade it effectively,

12:57.838 --> 13:01.046
but that's a lot less exciting than like, a robot that does my

13:01.068 --> 13:04.690
laundry or something like that. That's why I'm personally excited about AI.

13:04.770 --> 13:08.258
It just seems so intuitive that it would be beneficial.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.722
It's just like it's already here. We're using AI all the time.

13:11.776 --> 13:15.530
There's always a new app that's doing something with AI.

13:16.110 --> 13:19.830
That's why I just love it. What do you think about crypto, specifically crypto?

13:19.910 --> 13:23.646
Obviously the markets are in turmoil, everyone's losing a ton of money.

13:23.748 --> 13:27.214
I still think that crypto is cool and beneficial and

13:27.252 --> 13:30.986
worth pursuing and worth having. I just don't necessarily think it's

13:31.098 --> 13:34.366
the only thing that we should be focusing on. I don't see

13:34.388 --> 13:38.686
a world where crypto cures cancer. It's a real stretch

13:38.798 --> 13:41.982
to say that crypto is going to create more economic efficiency

13:42.046 --> 13:45.746
and that's going to be the thing that cures cancer. It's like maybe or like

13:45.768 --> 13:49.414
maybe you're storing some cancer data on the blockchain and then

13:49.532 --> 13:52.978
that somehow becomes relevant to cancer researchers.

13:53.074 --> 13:56.374
It's a real stretch. I think crypto is good. I just don't think it's the

13:56.412 --> 14:00.234
only good technology, which is what a lot of, like, maxis think, a lot of

14:00.272 --> 14:03.610
maximalists think. What was it like meeting Elon Musk?

14:04.350 --> 14:08.294
This is funny, I actually haven't met Elon Musk. He has tried soylent,

14:08.342 --> 14:11.834
though. We set up a food truck in downtown La.

14:11.872 --> 14:15.286
And he just like, stopped by, which was cool. So I saw a photo

14:15.318 --> 14:18.394
of him drinking soylent, which was awesome. His chief of staff

14:18.442 --> 14:21.946
invested in my company, which was cool. And I've been to events where he's

14:21.978 --> 14:26.078
been there, but I haven't actually gotten to meet him yet. Now I

14:26.084 --> 14:29.106
don't know that I'd have a lot to ask him, even though obviously I make

14:29.128 --> 14:32.786
videos about him all the time. I think what would be more interesting would be

14:32.888 --> 14:36.194
for him to talk to another expert that

14:36.232 --> 14:39.814
can actually debate him on some of these points. I really want to see

14:39.852 --> 14:43.206
him debate Vitalik about crypto, and I would love

14:43.228 --> 14:47.302
to see him talk to George Hots about self driving cars because

14:47.356 --> 14:50.682
I feel like they would have a much better conversation than I ever

14:50.736 --> 14:54.138
could have with someone like that. So yeah, I think in general I want to

14:54.144 --> 14:57.706
see more debates between world experts as

14:57.728 --> 15:01.402
opposed to just more. Every individual expert goes around

15:01.456 --> 15:04.814
to all of the podcasters and they do individual interviews that are

15:04.852 --> 15:07.886
okay, but they don't really ever come into contact with each

15:07.908 --> 15:11.518
other. I think that that's what would be really, really entertaining. We used to

15:11.524 --> 15:14.666
have debates, but we don't really have them anymore because they're

15:14.698 --> 15:17.806
very, very risky to participate in. Well, that's it. If you have any more questions,

15:17.908 --> 15:21.594
just leave me a comment below. And if you're not already subscribed, please subscribe,

15:21.642 --> 15:24.160
